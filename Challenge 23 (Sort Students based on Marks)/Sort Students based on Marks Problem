Sort Students based on Marks

The program must accept the name and the marks in three subjects (Maths, Physics, Chemistry) of N students as the input. The program must sort the students based on the marks in Maths in descending order. If two or more students have the same marks in Maths, then the program must sort those students based on the marks in Physics in descending order. If two or more students have the same marks in Maths and Physics, then the program must sort those students based on the marks in Chemistry in descending order. If two or more students have the same marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry, then the program must sort the students based on the name in ascending order.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Length of each student's name <= 20
1 <= Marks in each subject <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each containing the name of the student followed by the marks scored in maths, physics and chemistry separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first N lines, each containing the name of the student followed by the marks scored in maths, physics and chemistry separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
xxyz 85 99 86
stuuuv 91 92 100
efggg 85 99 72
aabbcc 91 92 100

Output:
aabbcc 91 92 100
stuuuv 91 92 100
xxyz 85 99 86
efggg 85 99 72

Explanation:
The students stuuuv and aabbcc scored the same marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry (91, 92, 100). So they are sorted based on their names in ascending order.
The students xxyz and efggg scored the same marks in Maths and Physics (85, 99). So they are sorted in descending order based on the marks in Chemistry.
Hence the output is
aabbcc 91 92 100
stuuuv 91 92 100
xxyz 85 99 86
efggg 85 99 72

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5

Xyzz 83 95 64
Mnnnno 83 100 89
Ijjkkk 83 95 79
Abcd 93 85 76

Output:
Abcd 93 85 76
Pppqrs 93 85 76
Mnnnno 83 100 89
Ijjkkk 83 95 79
Xyzz 83 95 64
